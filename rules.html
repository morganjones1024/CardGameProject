    <p style="text-align: center">
        War is a very simple card game for two players. Much like real war it's incredibly long and pointless. It's mostly a kids game, since it relies exclusively on luck of the draw. Like most card games it has plenty of regional variations, but the rules used on this site are the standard rules from Wikipedia. The game is played as follows:</li>
        <ol>
        <li>Each player gets dealt half the deck, 26 cards, and the cards are put face down in a stack in front of the players.</li>
        <li>oth players turn their top card face up at the same time. The person with the higher card wins that draw, and takes both the cards. They are put to the side to form a new stack, which the player can use when he finishes his current stack.</li>
        <li>If both players draw a card of the same rank, e.g. they both draw 8s, then there's a war. The face up cards are left on the table and each player puts three cards face down on the table, and then puts one card face up. The face up card determines who wins the war and gets all 10 cards that are on the table at this point. If the face up card is again the same rank, then the war goes on, three more face down, one face up etc.</li>
        <li>First player to finish all their cards loses the game.
        <li>If a player finishes their cards during a war without having enough cards to finish the war then he loses immediately.</li>
        </ol> 
        That's all there is to it. Just a lot of clicking on cards and hoping for the best! Enjoy :)
