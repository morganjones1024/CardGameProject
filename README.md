# CardGameProject
Group Project week 3-day 3,4, and 5 March 25,2022

## Summary
This was a group project in regards of creating a functional program by combining all programs that were learned within the first 3 weeks of the TTS Full-stack course program. There were three options to choose from: tip calculator, a card game/poker game, or a to-do list.  But, group 2, decided to choose the card game.

Dustin Price and David Warren were focused on JavaScript in making the game functional.  Having both the user and the cpu have a score once either or scored a point.  Morgan Jones and Adrienne Burney focused on the visual representation by having a home page, rule page, and an about page. 

The focus was to create a functional card game of war by having player one (left side) press the Hit to Go button to start the game. 

### How it is played:
The overall setting has a feel of a casino/poker game with a green poker table with gadgets for the user to use in order to play the game.
The user presses the "Hit to go" button to begin playing the game. Each round displays the relative card values for the player and computer, compares them, and returns a score. The program also keeps track of how many cards are dealt/discarded from each, and uses that, per the rules of the War card game, to determine an ultimate winner/loser condition. The user continues to push the "play" button until they, or the computer, reach no cards in their deck or discard piles, at which point the player with no cards left is designated as the loser.

### Software used:
Visual Studio Code
#### Random Unexpected Challenges
1.    Having a downloaded GitHub folder from Morgan’s GitHub and trying to connect it back from Adrienne’s edits without overriding the entire teams’ format/work.

2.    Making sure that each page appears on the live server.

3.    Coming to a common ground with several options from everyone’s participation and role to the project.

#### Solutions/solving the issue: 
    True collaboration! We are all different, and collaborating is key to success. Most of our issues were fixable only after we worked together. We had to patch a few things by merging in Git and taking a step back to reevaluate our strategy to determine if we created a larger scope than necessary to accomplish the project.
